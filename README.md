# DoomGVR
Doom for Gear VR

I will add more to this over time, but to build this you will need to set up the Oculus Mobile SDK as per instructions.

The build.bat should then build and deploy if you use the following command:

build release

You will need to copy your phone's osig file to the assets folder in order for it to build and deploy
